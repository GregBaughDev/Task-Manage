# Task-Manage

This was initial attempt at building a kanban board project management app in React. This version incorporated both functional and class based components. I also
incorporated a drag and drop library into this project but struggle to integrate it with my seed data. I decided to focus on learning hooks in depth and I have since
rebuilt this project using only functional components. It can be viewed [here](https://github.com/GregBaughDev/Task-Manage-v2/blob/main/README.md).

This project is no longer being developed.
